## Checking the ConfigMap

I defined the ConfigMap and configured volumes to use it. Then, I packaged and installed the new version of my app.
Let's check the pods.

```text
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
app-python-7465dc78cf-p8zvm   1/1     Running   0          22s
```

Inside the pod, let's concatenate the config.json file

```text
$ kubectl exec app-python-7465dc78cf-p8zvm -- cat /config.json
{
  "TIMEZONE": "Europe/Moscow"
}
```
