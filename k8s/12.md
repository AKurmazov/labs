## Checking the ConfigMap

I defined the ConfigMap and configured volumes to use it. Then, I packaged and installed the new version of my app.
Let's check the pods.

```text
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
app-python-7465dc78cf-p8zvm   1/1     Running   0          22s
```

Inside the pod, let's concatenate the config.json file

```text
$ kubectl exec app-python-7465dc78cf-p8zvm -- cat /config.json
{
  "TIMEZONE": "Europe/Moscow"
}
```

## [Bonus] Definitions

* StatefulSet — takes care of pods scaling within a predefined set, guarantees the order of deployment of pods, and also the uniqueness by using a unique identity for each one of them
* Headless Service — a service that has no allocated IP address, thus, there is also no load balancing for such service
* Persistent Volumes — a type of storage (a resource) within a cluster that requires provisioning; persistent volumes do not depend on pods in terms of lifecycle configuration
